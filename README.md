# shortcuts
A collection of scripts that simplify life at IGMK

Sometimes work is hard and googling is harder, this scripts are ment to simplify the use of redundant commands [SEE ME](https://preview.redd.it/b2463cm4lqg31.gif?format=mp4&v=enabled&s=6b359cf69606d096ca957106775622a386d7c0af)

These scripts work and are tested on Ubuntu. Other Linux distributions work similarly. MacOSX is probably also fine.

## Installation
Clone the repository

Make the script you want to use executable

    chmod u+x name_of_the_script

It might be an idea also to add the repository folder to your path such that you can use it as a command from anywhere. Add this line to your .bashrc

    export PATH=$PATH:<PATH_TO_SHORTCUTS_REPOSITORY>

and, also to .bash_profile if you want the same behaviour on login and non-login shells

## Dependencies
Each script has its own...

## Usage
Have a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/igmk/shortcuts/wiki)
